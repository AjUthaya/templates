# Containerization Templates

Templates for docker run & docker compose

## Technologies

### Docker

Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization". Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own application, tools, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. Containers are created from "images" that specify their precise contents.

### Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

### NGINX

NGINX accelerates content and application delivery, improves security, facilitates availability and scalability for the busiest web sites on the Internet. Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and first publicly released in 2004.

### CertBot

Certbot is an easy-to-use automatic client that fetches and deploys SSL/TLS certificates for your web server. Certbot was developed by EFF and others as a client for Let’s Encrypt and was previously known as “the official Let’s Encrypt client” or “the Let’s Encrypt Python client.” Certbot will also work with any other CAs that support the ACME protocol.
